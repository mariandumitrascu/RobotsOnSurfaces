## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

# install.packages("NoiseFiltersR", dependencies = TRUE)

library(NoiseFiltersR)

x_noise <- x_train_processed %>% select(-series_id, -group_id)

x_noise2 <- edgeBoostFilter(surface ~ phi_mean_all + theta_mean_all + psi_mean_all, x_noise)

x_noise2
x_noise2$cleanData
x_noise2$remIdx
# out_For <- edgeBoostFilter(Species~., iris)

x_train_processed <- x_train_processed[-x_noise2$remIdx,]

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
